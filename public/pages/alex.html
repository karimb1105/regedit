                happy birthday, alex. you have no idea the amount of times i've read the words that you wrote here that first night we fell for each other. i've never edited it because i want you to be the next person to change what it says as we grow and evolve together. you have become the man that i love but much, much more than that. you are my best friend, my boyfriend, my head chef, my sous chef, my top, my bottom, my fellow music critic, and so much more. i love you, your smile, your personality, your hair, your cute little facial hair, and i can't wait to grow old with you. you're the love of my life, the one and only. i'm so glad we found each other. te quiero mucho muchisimo a usted y espero que le guste esta pagina. this is what i was doing on those facetime calls asking you about things from the past. i'm so glad you're turning 20 when you're in my life and i hope you'll be in my life when we're forty and much, much beyond that. i can't wait to see you et je t'aime encore plus que tu ne le sais. il faut que tu saches que tu es la seule personne qui peut me faire sourire comme Ã§a, et tu serais toujours ce qui me rend heureux, plus que rien.
